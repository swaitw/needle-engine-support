# Scripting Examples

[Video tutorial: How to write custom components](https://youtu.be/uf5UK0bLHlY?si=82U_2L4n2V7XL7RJ)

Below you will find a few basic scripts as a quick reference. 

We also offer a lot of sample scenes and complete projects that you can download and use as a starting point:  
- [Visit Samples Website](https://engine.needle.tools/samples?utm_source=needle_docs&utm_content=scripting_examples)
- [Download Samples Package](https://engine.needle.tools/downloads/unity/samples)
- [Needle Engine Stackblitz Collection](https://stackblitz.com/@marwie/collections/needle-engine)
- [Needle Engine API](https://engine.needle.tools/api)

## Basic component 
<stackblitz file="@code/basic-component.ts"></stackblitz> 
@[code ts twoslash](@code/basic-component.ts)

see [scripting](scripting#lifecycle-methods) for all component events

## Reference an Object from Unity
@[code ts twoslash](@code/component-object-reference.ts)  

## Reference and load an asset from Unity (Prefab or SceneAsset)
@[code ts twoslash](@code/component-prefab.ts)

## Reference and load scenes from Unity

## Receive Clicks on Objects
Add this script to any object in your scene that you want to be clickable. Make sure to also have an `ObjectRaycaster` component in the parent hierarchy of that object.  

<stackblitz file="@code/component-click.ts">
test
</stackblitz> 

@[code ts twoslash](@code/component-click.ts)


## Networking Clicks on Objects

Add this script to any object in your scene that you want to be clickable. Make sure to also have an `ObjectRaycaster` component in the parent hierarchy of that object.   
The component will send the received click to all connected clients and will raise an event that you can then react to in your app. If you are using Unity or Blender you can simply assign functions to call to the `onClick` event to e.g. play an animation or hide objects.

@[code ts twoslash](@code/component-click-networking.ts)

### Play Animation on click
@[code ts twoslash](@code/component-animation-onclick.ts)

## Reference an Animation Clip
This can be useful if you want to run your custom animation logic.   
You can also export an array of clips.
@[code ts twoslash](@code/component-animationclip.ts)


## Create and invoke a UnityEvent

@[code ts twoslash](@code/component-unityevent.ts)
::: tip
EventList events are also invoked on the component level. This means you can also subscribe to the event declared above using ``myComponent.addEventListener("my-event", evt => {...})`` as well.   
This is an experimental feature. Please provide feedback in our [forum](https://forum.needle.tools/?utm_source=needle_docs&utm_content=content)

### Declare a custom event type
This is useful for when you want to expose an event to Unity or Blender with some custom arguments (like a string)
@[code ts twoslash](@code/component-customevent.ts)

_Example use:_  
![20221128-210735_Unity-needle](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2693840/204370950-4c89b877-90d7-4e6f-8266-3352e6da16f4.png)

## Use nested objects and serialization

You can nest objects and their data. With properly matching `@serializable(SomeType)` decorators, the data will be serialized and deserialized into the correct types automatically.  

In your typescript component:  
@[code ts twoslash](@code/component-nested-serialization.ts)

In C# in any script:  
@[code](@code/component-nested-serialization-cs.cs)

::: tip
Without the correct type decorators, you will still get the data, but just as a plain object. This is useful when you're porting components, as you'll have access to all data and can add types as required.
:::

## Use Web APIs
::: tip
Keep in mind that you still have access to all web apis and [npm](https://npmjs.org) packages!    
That's the beauty of Needle Engine if we're allowed to say this here ðŸ˜Š

### Display current location
@[code ts twoslash](@code/component-location.ts) 

### Display current time using a Coroutine
@[code ts twoslash](@code/component-time.ts)

## Change custom shader property

Assuming you have a custom shader with a property name `_Speed` that is a float value this is how you would change it from a script.   
You can find a live [example to download in our samples](https://engine.needle.tools/samples/shaders/)

<!-- SAMPLE modify custom shader material property -->


## Switching src attribute

See [live example](https://stackblitz.com/edit/needle-engine-cycle-src?file=index.html) on StackBlitz


## Adding new postprocessing effects

Make sure to install [`npm i postprocessing`](https://github.com/pmndrs/postprocessing) in your web project. Then you can add new effects by deriving from `PostProcessingEffect`.  

To use the effect add it to the same object as your `Volume` component.

Here is an example that wraps the [Outline postprocessing effect](https://pmndrs.github.io/postprocessing/public/demo/#outline). You can expose variables and settings as usual as any effect is also just a component in your three.js scene.

@[code](@code/custom-post-effect.ts) 


## Custom ParticleSystem Behaviour


@[code ts twoslash](@code/custom-particle-system-behaviour.ts) 


## Custom 2D Audio Component

This is an example how you could create your own audio component.   
For most usecases however you can use the core AudioSource component and don't have to write code.

@[code ts twoslash](@code/component-2d-audio.ts)


## Arbitrary external files

Use the FileReference type to load external files (e.g. a json file)
@[code ts twoslash](@code/component-filereference.ts)

<!-- SAMPLE receive click from HTML button
## Receiving html element click in component

<!-- SAMPLE disable environment light

<!-- SAMPLE using mediapipe with hands
