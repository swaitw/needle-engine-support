# Editor Sync

Needle allows for a very fast, iterative workflow between Unity and the browser. Usually, exports take less than a few seconds. However, once scenes become more complex, for some types of changes (adjusting material properties, nudging objects around), we provide an even faster way to see your changes â€“ **Editor Sync**.

## How to use Editor Sync

You can enable Editor Sync by adding the `EditorSync` component to your scene. This component will connect your Unity Editor with your browser project and automatically sync applicable changes between the two.

**Editor Sync** is currently an experimental feature. Please let us know about your experience with it! We're eager to hear your feedback.
